# SOTA

## Baseline
The organizers' starter circuit (P §4: inject one physical |T⟩, encode with H and CNOT, transpile to the
grid) scores 1-F = 0.0252 with 28 CX and acceptance 1.0 (P §4.2 sample output). Teams "Noah" and "lss"
sit exactly there. Checked 2026-10-23.

## Current best
Ours on the board: **v10**, server 1-F = 0.000121114674449697, acceptance 0.6866, 115 CX, submitted
2026-10-23 20:05:30 (`work/submit.py status`); 3-seed mean 1.2208e-4.

Competitors (board 2026-10-23 20:08 KST): Placeholder 0.0001242, 133 CX, acceptance 0.615 (0.000422 at
16:03, 0.000129 at 18:36); the next team is at 0.00794.
